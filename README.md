# Unsupervised Book Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Unsupervised Book Recommendation System** project repository. This project focuses on creating a book recommendation system using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The analysis and system implementation are performed using Jupyter Notebook and relevant files.

## Files

- `Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Book_recommendation_system.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for building an unsupervised book recommendation system. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and generating book recommendations.
- `__init__.py`, `app.py`, `pyvenv.cfg`, `requirements.txt`, `septy.py`: Additional files or scripts related to the project implementation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Book_recommendation_system.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Run the notebook cells to understand the process of building an unsupervised book recommendation system.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook covers data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for building the recommendation system.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as collaborative filtering or clustering, to create personalized book recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Explore methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendation system and its ability to suggest relevant books.

## Contributing
